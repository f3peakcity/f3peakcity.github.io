## Lead right

There's an expression in F3 that you are "freed to lead." Whether it's plugging into an existing effort or starting a new training program or service opportunity, you are welcome not only to join, but to lead.

In person at an AO or virtually on Slack are the best places to connect with the Pax as you plan out a new leadership opportunity.
