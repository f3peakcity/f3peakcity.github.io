## Always Free.</br>Always Outside.</br>Open to All Men.

Join us for 20+ free workouts right here in the "Peak of Good Living" in Apex, NC and the surrounding areas of Friendship, New Hill, and Jordan Lake.

The workouts are for men of all fitness levels and goals, and include running; cardio with total-body and body-weight exercises; limited run and strength-building with dumbells, kettleballs, and other toys; walking; rucking; recovery stretching and yoga; and even paddleboarding in warm months!

## Lead right

There's an expression in F3 that you are "freed to lead." Whether it's plugging into an existing effort or starting a new training program or service opportunity, you are welcome not only to join, but to lead.

In person at an AO or virtually on Slack are the best places to connect with the Pax as you plan out a new leadership opportunity.
