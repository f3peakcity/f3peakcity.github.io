Are you standing (or wobbling) on a paddleboard, aimlessly holding an oar, and wondering how you could possibly lead a workout on the water? 

Workout routines for standup paddleboarding follow many of the best practices discussed in [How to Q](https://f3peakcity.com/articles/how-to-q/). However, for some board-specific ideas, consider the following.

## General workout ideas

The following workout formats tend to work particularly well for SUP.

* 7's, either paddling to different points or swimming
* DORA, possibly paddling around a buoy or swimming
* Tabata of exercises on board
* Yoga
* Paddling techniques

## Board-friendly exercises

The following types of exercises work particularly well on SUPs because you are more balanced:
* Abs
* Merkins
* Squats

Looking for ways to make these harder?
* Try variations of the exercises with fewer points of contact, like scorpion merkins.
* Destabilize the board with rocking movements.
* Move away from dead-center on the board.
* Perform exercises perpendicular to, not in line with, the board. Ex: Scooch toward the tail of the SUP until the nose comes off the water, and come into a V-sit, with your body perpendicular to the rails and your legs over the water. Hold until failure.

For exercises that involve the board itself:
* Running
* Walking the plank (up and down)
* Firedrills (running, then jumping off side and back when called)
* Arm paddle til stop
* Leg paddle til stop

## Paddling techniques

You might be wondering what are some paddling techniques. One of the best sources is to look for videos on YouTube. Although be ware, you might find plenty of fake news and learn the wrong way, as apparently Clockwork did for holding an oar.

Here are some general techniques.

**Walking**:
* Relax feet by wiggling toes and shift feet back and forth
* Don't make the board go side to side
* Both feet "jump" slide, keep on center
* Use paddle for 3-point contact, more balance

**Practice standing above the center and below**:
* Above, bow goes down/stern up, goes straighter but slower
* Behind, bow goes up/stern down, goes faster, leaves wake

**To paddle fast & straight**:
* Knees slightly bent, eyes forward, core tight
* You should be bending into it to paddle fast
* Don't paddle much behind your back, or the board starts to turn
* Paddle fully submerged in water
* Straight lines

**More advanced postures**:
* Making a triangle with your feet and board
* Foot at back, staggered, and spin around in a circle
* 1-legged and paddle - same side
* Move with at least two points (paddle in the water)
