## 🎒 The 100 Bag Challenge
### **Take. Fill. Drop. Repeat.**

---

## 🎯 The Mission

Phase 2 of our 100 Challenge is here — **THE LONG HAUL**. 

We're delivering sustained, consistent support to [NeighborUp](https://neighborup.org) with the most essential pantry items families need. This isn't a one-time drop — it's an ongoing commitment to our neighbors facing food insecurity.

**100 branded F3 Peak City bags. Multiple waves. Real impact.**

---

## 🏘️ Serving the Triangle Community

The 100 Bag Challenge supports families in **Apex, Cary, Holly Springs, and surrounding Wake County communities** through our partnership with NeighborUp. When you fill a bag, you're directly helping your neighbors right here in the Triangle.

## 💥 Why These Items?

These aren't random — they're **the most requested pantry essentials** that [NeighborUp](https://neighborup.org) families need but struggle to afford. Your filled bag directly supports a family's weekly meals and basic needs.
