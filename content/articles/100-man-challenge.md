## 🎯 The Mission

We’re calling on **100 men** to step up and give **ANY amount** to support families in crisis right here in Peak City through **NeighborUp** — the unified force of Dorcas Ministries and Western Wake Crisis Ministry.

Whether it’s **$5, $50, or $500**, your gift says loud and clear:  
**“I’m one of the 100.”**

---

## Why This Matters

Right now, families in our community are facing impossible choices:

- **Pay rent or buy groceries?**  
- **Keep the lights on or fill prescriptions?**  
- **Put gas in the car or feed their kids?**

With reduced SNAP benefits and rising costs, **demand is higher than ever**. NeighborUp has already served **thousands of neighbors**, and your support fuels real, immediate help.

No family should have to make these choices. **You can help change their story.**

## ⚡ Our Goal: $10,000

We’re aiming for **$10,000** to support NeighborUp’s Season of Giving campaign — part of their ambitious **$1 million goal** to keep families housed, fed, and financially stable.

### 🌊 The Rising Tide

In F3, we talk about the **1st F** (fitness), the **2nd F** (fellowship), and the **3rd F** (faith/service). This challenge is pure 3rd F — stepping up, lifting up, and serving those who need it most.

When we rise together, we create a tide that lifts everyone.
