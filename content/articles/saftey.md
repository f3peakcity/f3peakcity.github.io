Returning from Montana last night with my M, we had a connection in ATL.  What you see in the picture stopped me in my tracks.

Our team gathered for annual training in Anaconda and included a couple of First Aid/CPR/AED classes in the agenda.  I had the pleasure of supporting/attending one of them Thursday afternoon and refreshing/learning new skills. 

The next morning I couldn’t help but give kudos to those who participated and spoke briefly about the impact and the (positive, galvanizing) ripple effect of the Damar Hamlin incident. For example, check out the `#3forHeart` challenge going around Twitter.

That incident stopped me in my tracks, too, but also a legion of people well beyond NFL fans. As for the CPR training device in ATL, I had never heard or seen such a thing before.

I’m old enough to recall all the fun on arcade machines, as are many of you.

Yes, SAF3TY can be made to be engaging and entertaining, we can all agree.  Yes, we even had some fun in that First Aid/CPR/AED class on Thursday as the snow fell outside.  Particularly with the fancy "smart" dummies that blinked lights to let us know whether or not our chest thrusts and cadence were on point.

There was no one practicing on the CPR machine in ATL at the time. Hopefully people will not see it as a game, but rather an opportunity to practice a critical skill in a simple, straightforward way.

Are you interested in CPR-AED training?  We have two classes set up for February.  It’s certain to be engaging, fun, and memorable.  If those options don’t work, more can be arranged as necessary.  Any questions, please reach out to YHC or Coco Crisp.  Thank you.
