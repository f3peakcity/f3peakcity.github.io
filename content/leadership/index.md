  - Any questions about starting a workout or doing something new in Fitness? These are your guys!

  - Lead a team of men planning and assisting guys to get Faith-based activities going like Bible studies, book studies, or service projects. Any questions in this area, get at them!

- FNG Q: TBD

  - These HIM follow up with new guys and make sure they are plugged into the region.

- Weasel Shaker: TBD

  - The weasel shaker name comes from ‘shaking’ the guys who try to weasel out of what they said they will do. If you’ve been in Carpex more than 3 days, chances are that you know Banjo and he knows you. You say you wanna do something, Banjo will hold you to it.

- Comz: Wahoo (Comz Q), Clockwork (newsletter), TBD (Social Media):

  - These are the men to help you promote your next great plan.

- Expansion Q: TBD

  - This role focuses on strategic expansion both within our region and at the boundaries. The job is to make sure we are growing men in all phases of leadership so that when we get ready to launch the next Region…there are men already in place in each area which make the launch easy.
