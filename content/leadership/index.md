F3 is peer-led, and as part of that leadership, these PAX make up the Shared Leadership Team (SLT) in Peak City and focus on the invigoration of male community leadership. Whether that's thinking about new ways to motivate and encourage or helping launch new workouts, this team is here to support PAX as they grow and serve.
