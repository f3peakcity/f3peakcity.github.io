7 at A-Team. 18 at DTP. 25!! at Lion’s Den. Difficult to scale, and I’m learning a lot still.

## 0530

Several mallwalkers and motherruckers out with the bootcampers this morning. An EC runner or two.All assembled, no FNGs, lots of familiar faces, Pledge of Allegiance, statement that we’ll keep pretty close to the flag, and we immediately have to move (too many pax for the first exercise).

### Warmup

First was a follow-me to the coziest spot in Peak City for some Good Mornings (missed you Big Red). Some HillBillys, my new favorite super-slow Abe Vigoda, then 5-count around the circle of plankarama (some alterations). That was a LONG plank. 25 SSH to get some things moving again, then we’re off to the pullup bars.

### Thang 1

Once there, YHC explained that we were going to do SquatUps (totally made it up) where the pax will be doing squats in 2 lines that advance towards the pull-up bars, while one pax does 5 pull ups then rotates back to the back. Squats turned out not to be the best choice…will do my homework…but the pull-ups were enjoyed.

After 2 rotations, we took off towards Churchwood Drive. Along the way, we bearcrawled between the magic lights, then jogged to the end of the street where we did the world’s quietest star jumps. Moseyed back, this time lungewalking the magic lights.

### Thang 2

Then we set off on a mobile mucho chesto. 10 merkins, then run a 1/8th mile lap. Standard, wide grip, offset left, offset right, and diamond got us all set. Once the pax were in, back to the pullup bars, but this time it was one long line of moving planks, while one pax did 10 Australian pullups (that I erroneously called plankmerkins). Fail. This was mildly meh. Cheap Trick liked that we hit the bars twice. That makes 2 of us.

### Thang 3

Next it was off for a tour of my 2.x’s old stomping grounds, the old Parish Athletics field. One big Native People’s run around the field, didn’t lose anyone, then we headed for the steps.

Arriving at the steps, it was 7s with burpees at the bottom and L/R=1 American Hammers at the top. 1 burpee at the bottom to start.

Upon finishing/with time expiring (thanks Hamm) it was a quick mosey back to the flag, with just enough time to squeak in 50 LBCs on my up. (Was called soft as I didn’t call them in-cadence)…

And time expired at 44:47 by my watch. 2.32 miles, right in line with the 2.31 yesterday and 2.3 Monday. Mileage minimums met.

## COT

We finished up with a countarama and namearama. Q fail again as we counted off, came up with 24, and moved on to Namearama, when we noticed a Lone Wolf returning to the pack, and added HIM, to make 25.

Announcements: Check the Slacks. Update your profile if you’re a new Peak City Slack member (note there’s an ICE field that is editable if using the desktop version of Slack). Pivot showed off Green Level’s green and invited Peak City to attend their secession party on 1/27. Coffeeteria at Wake Oasis.

### Praise/Prayers

* Praise for Imp’s son being baptized this Saturday at Apex LDS.
* Prayers for I-Beam’s M and for Pivot’s dad’s mobility.

### NMS

Not my best planning. The Thangs had potential, but need to figure out the waiting that occurs with limited resources like 2 pull up bars. It was fun hanging with you all, and as discussed with Sour Mash, really like the ability to see everyone even when we’re a little spread out.

Thanks men for helping me celebrate this week. 3 down, 3 to go. Be ready to move at Bounty Hunters tomorrow.
