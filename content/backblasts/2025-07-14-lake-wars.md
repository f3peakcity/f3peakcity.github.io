> EPISODE IV: A NEW LAKE

![Harris Lake Warning](/img/backblasts/board-harris-launch.jpg)

It is a period of aquatic disruption.

Hurricane Chantal, striking

from churning skies, has

claimed victory over

the peaceful waters of

JORDAN LAKE.

During the storm’s fury, four

brave paddlers managed to discover

alternative routes to fitness glory,

HARRIS LAKE, a shimmering body

of water with enough

power to sustain an entire

workout routine.

Pursued by the lingering

effects of nature’s wrath, this

intrepid crew races across

uncharted waters aboard their

vessels, guardians of the

sacred paddle strokes that can save

their fitness goals and restore

balance to their training galaxy...
