The evening AO, nearly killed by covid and the WFH trend, yet proves oddly resilient, mutating in unexpected ways. Just like the park rangers thought they could kick us out of ANP, the evening AO, cockroach-like, lives on. If disgusting bug metaphors and existential F3 AO musings aren't your thing, you clearly haven't read enough backblasts. And so, YHC presents you with this.

## Warmup

So many people with dogs, I changed my initial plan to run down the hill and around to bear crawl bridge.

Running stretches: carioca, butt kicks, high knees. On a scale of `1 - Poi`, my outfit was ranked near-Poiness. If only I had brought a change of clothes for post-workout drip, alas.

At the pavilion, standard warmup stuff like good mornings, Nolan Ryans, imperial walkers, and hillbillies.

Along the way, Hail Naw of verging on 1-year in F3 got to meet Peeping Tom, who has been in for 5, although YHC doesn't recall a 5-year anny Q.

## Thang 1

A mosey down to the pullup bars brought us in contact with more park patrons, two young boys who wondered what on earth we were doing at the pullup bars with our terrible form. And so, yet again, YHC readjusted my initial plan for Thang 1 and ran us up to the shelter at the top of the hill. 

_(Note: Merkins, werkins, irkins, and derkins, along with sprints, were sprinkled with care throughout this workout during the runs.)_

Benchwork leg circuit:
* One-legged step-ups
* One-legged step-downs
* One-legged Bulgarian squats
* 1-minute people's chair
* Flip-flop & repeato

Cheap Trick as Site Q showed great care for the pax, making sure those around the corner were accounted for during the people's chair.

## Thang 2

Running back down to the pond, the pullup bars were free. Perfect for an upper-body rock routine.

* 30 curls
* 20 triceps
* 25 somethings I've forgotten
* 5 rockees
* 15 Sven presses

In between, run around the pond and do 5 pullups. Had to change directions a few times to avoid all the disc golfers...so much EH potential!

## Thang 3

Courtesy of Prodigal and the core challenge, an ab pyramid. YHC has to slim down for his Halloween costume this weekend.

* 25 Flutter Kicks

`At this point in the evening, 3 prim-n-proper Mormon boys spilled out from the bathrooms, found us fluttering on the ground, and laughingly joined us. They weren't laughing for long.`

* 25 Half Sit Ups
* 50 Flutter Kicks - YHC counted silently so as not to demoralize
* 50 Half Sit Ups
* 25 Flutter Kicks
* 25 Half Sit Ups

## Cooldown

The pax thought surely since we had done Mary, we were done. Unfortunately not. After a quick jaunt back around the pond and a sprint up the hill, we returned to base for some signature Clockwork yoga.

* Mountain-scarecrow circuit
* One-legged stretch circut

## COT
