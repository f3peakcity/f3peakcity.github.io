Three years have flown by. Some things have changed, such as our region, our workout locations, many of our pax, some dumb new trend of Bay City Scissors, the 4th F, my weight. Some things have stayed the same, such as busy fall F3 schedules that take up just about every free weekend you have, Chiquita's 5-minute grace period, Greater Carpex having the best newsletter in F3 Nation, Wake-O refusing to put my coffee in the cup I bring, or YHC having too much Q-drenaline and starting off too hot out the gate.

And some things, like backblasts, are about more than just workout.

## EC

4 for a brisk EC on a slightly long and hilly route, especially when 3 of us are planning to do the MFRFSP.

## Warmup

* Run, then Nolan Ryans
* Run, then low Sumo squats followed by a bat wings circuit
* Run to the warmup circle for broga-esque stretches and burpees

## Thang 1

At the big parking lot, run big pickle. Then down one of the lanes, do an exercise, and run the pickle to the next (so the pickle gets smaller and smaller as time goes on).

* Round 1: **Bear crawl**
* Round 2: **Lunges**
* Round 3: **Crawl bear**
* Round 4: **Backwards duck walk**

## Thang 2

At the auditorium-style stairs, a quick round of stationary-agility work.

Round 1:
* P1: People's chair
* P2: Up the stairs Paula Abdul-style, "two steps forward, one step back"...surprisingly no one got injured

Round 2:
* P1: Balls to the wall
* P2: Backwards up the stairs, rail optional

Round 3:
* P1: Plank
* P2: Regular up the stairs

## Thang 3

Back at the first parking lot:
* Sprint down the lot
* Ascending count of 5-10-15-20 merkins
* Repeato back down

As YHC promised Red Ryder, we would get lots of merkins, 80 by my count, depending on how fast we go.

## COT

**Announcements**: MFRFSP this Saturday, Thanksgiving options, Freed to Bleed Dec. 2nd, Christmas party Dec. 13th.

**Praises**: birth of Danny's aka Chiquita's son Nicholas James; my three year anniversary; everyone for continuing to show up, accelerate, and hold each other accountable.

## NMS

I hope Franklin will forgive me for setting a pace that was not conducive to mumblechatter.

Chiquita Banana posted only two days after his newborn. See, Peaches, it is possible, _s√≠ se puede_!

If you lost a headlamp, someone has it.

Great to see so many people at the Q!

Tortoises had 100% coffeeteria participation...Lion's Den, slightly less.

## 12 Takeaways

Taking a trip down memory lane, apparently YHC likes lists of 12.

* [Year 1 backblast](https://f3carpex.com/12-reflections-on-1-year-with-f3-carpex/)
* [Year 2 backblast](https://f3carpex.com/12-ways-that-year-2-differed-from-year-1/)

So here's another list of Year 3 takeaways.

3 things that went well:
1. Injured less...we'll see if that holds after the MFRFSP
2. Peak City region launch and momentum
3. Lots of races

3 things to do better:
1. Training consistency, including strength and rest days
2. Shield Lock consistency 
3. Engage more with pax

3 things to try this upcoming year:
1. 50-miler
2. A fastish race
3. Nutrition

3 bits of advice:
1. Call exercises in 12 counts or something that's not a multiple 5 to push the pax a little
2. Have an AO home that you go to each week for consistency; that's what I miss most about not being a site Q at Dante's Peak anymore
3. Do a 3rd F event; we have so many options! Check out the blood drive coming up

An aside, several pax commented that date-wise, it doesn't make sense that each of my anniversaries as well as my first post were at Lion's Den. The actual anniversary will be this Saturday, which you can join me at the 24-hr Mike Fiorito Race for Second Place, if you like. But as for me, I like doing my anniversary Qs back at the AO where it all began.

Thanks for helping me to make it a great year!
