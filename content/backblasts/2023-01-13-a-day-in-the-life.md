7 at A-Team. 18 at DTP. 25!! at Lion’s Den. A little more manageable here at Bounty Hunters, where there was a STRONG Happy Dino contingent this morning. 21 total, with 11 bootcampers and 10 runners.

## 0530

As the pax arrived, I shared the news to some who had not heard, about the passing of an F3 Knoxville pax, Taylor Phelps (Cardinal) during his VQ the day before. One of his planned exercises (that he didn’t get to) was the “Air Bike” (Freddy Mercury). We would make that our last one in his honor today.

Pledge was recited, then off we went…wait, is that…yep…Chiquita Banana coming in hot at 5:31. We jogged on around the back of the soccer pitch, and he eventually met up with us as we arrived at Thales for…

## Warmup

5 penalty burpees, followed by a Big Red-led set of 5 Good Mornings. Did you know…that he can flawlessly give the explanation of why it is not necessary to have a good morning in order to make it a great day, all while flawlessly leading the pax in cadence of said exercises?

Nod to Hotspot…10 hacky sacks!

Abe Vigoda x 5…real nice and slow

Steve Earle x 10, deep and wide

SSH x 25 (at least that’s what I think we did…)

Then we took off on a little pickle lap, to come back for…

## THANG 1

Bearcrawl across the lot, 10 LBC

Crawlbear back, 10 star jumps

Crabcrawl across, 10 homer to marge

Crawlcrab back, 10 jump squats

Time to move on to the next event…and a Safety First road crossing.

### A Day in the Life

24 lights illuminate the path around the lake. Time to take a tour. First lap, Jog at a fair clip from light to light. At each light, perform 2 merkins. Once we finish the lap, do the last 2 merkins together to get 50. Second lap, same premise, only 2 LBCs at each light, followed by 2 at the end. Ended up being harder than expected, all the getups.

Safely make our way back across the Peakway and head for the parking lot near FiA. Stop for a round of quick feet on the curb (25) followed by 25 curb dips. Mosey on over to check out the ladies, who are CRUSHING it on the field. Q momentarily thought about monkey humpers, then settled on a mediocre BTTW showing. No one was impressed.

Done with those shenanigans, we climbed the steps and skipped (yes, skipped) for a ways along the backstretch. Having enough of that, we shifted to a mosey, and wound our way around the edge of the skate bowls…to get mileage right there to 2.3, same as past 3 days.

I’m thinking we threw in some SSHs here (could be mistaken), but I KNOW we did Supermans x 10 and WWIIs x 10, finishing with 10 Air Bikes (Freddy Mercury)

## COT

We finished up with a countarama and namearama. We were joined by all the runner dudes (a TON of ’em!)

Announcements: Check the Slacks. Update your profile if you’re a new Peak City Slack member (note there’s an ICE field that is editable if using the desktop version of Slack). Duck Donuts Dash coming up; check Slack. Green Level launch coming up 1/27; check Slack. Coffeeteria at Common Grounds.

### Praise/Prayers

Prayers for Cardinal and his family, plus the pax of Knoxville. Prayers for I Pity the Fool’s family. IIRC Chipper took us out.

### NMS

This was fun for me. Love using the lake in the workout; 24 lights are magical. A simple workout but it kept my HR up and working the whole time.

Thanks men for helping me celebrate this week. 4 down, 2 to go. Dazed and Confused will take on a more serious note tomorrow.
