Around **150 pax** from the Greater Carpex region participated in the 2024 Hill Climb Challenge. We ran, rucked, or walked a total of 5,300+ miles worth of hills, which would be enough to walk both from coast-to-coast and north-to-south across the USA. Which, come to think of it, might be the natural answer to people who are already asking, "What's next?" 

The event kicked off with a bang at midnight of February 10th, when several Peak City pax completed a ruck of Umstead, and continued apace until closing with the 4th Annual Duck Donuts Dash, hosted by South Cary on February 24th. In between were countless caravans to check off regional hills, rivalries new and old, travel and skiing trips that took people away, and strategic shenanigans to rally the pax to complete the HCC's goals of:

* Accelerate your 1st F by encouraging you to run, ruck, and walk more hills in two weeks than you thought possible or desirable.
* Foster Greater Carpex inter-region camaraderie and friendly rivalry.
* Get as many Pax as possible to contribute to these goals by completing the challenge together.

If you have ideas for the next iteration of the HCC, add them to the `Ideas for next time` tab on the spreadsheet. This year, we made several changes based on last year, including more promotion before the event (even with a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/9ygrF0aCjCw)!), hill segments closer to AOs, changing the point distribution to encourage other more participation, options for pax on travel or to self-organize events, and adding more cross-regional events.

## SYITG

Thanks to all the pax who participated, especially the following regional captains:
